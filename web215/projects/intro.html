        <h1>Hi, I'm Chris Wilson</h1>

        <p><strong>Personal background:</strong> Born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I went to R.I.T. until it proved too expensive and came back home where i’ve started a family and work while still reaching for the dream of being a full-stack developer. I have 2 daughters and a brand new Australian Cattle dog puppy. I also enjoy being very bad at video games.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently work as a full time software engineer at Bank of America. In the Automation adn reporting department of our real-time communications branch.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Academic background:</strong> I am currently pursuing a degree in Full Stack Development and, despite have a full-time job and family amongst other things, managed to maintain a 3.87 GPA. I am beyond ready for this to be done but I owe it to past me to see this through.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Background in this subject:</strong>  I’ve produced work for clients as well as working with other developers using web markup and scripting. I’m usually the weird one because I actually prefer EJS (embedding javascript) over other templating languages like handlebars, pug react etc.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  I use Windows 10 on my desktop and laptop. But I have no strong opinions about other OS, like some do.</p><br>
        <span><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong></span>
        <ul>
        <li>WEB115- Web markup and scripting- IT was required for my degree path and I also want to strengthen my foundation.</li>
        <li>Using DBA120-Database programming- Not a fan, I only take it because it’s required. I usually use mongodb and it’s good enough for my needs most of the time but I'm interested and open to see what I will learn.</li>
        <li>ABC123 - Advanced Alphabet Soup- It had very rigorous prereqs, but i’m very passionate about the art that is Alphabet soup so the class was a no brainer. I prefer my alphabet soup with a tomato base and only “Os” and meatballs. That counts… right?</li>
        <li>FYI002 - Introduction to Whatever-I’ve been known to have a very small nihilistic streak but I also value learning, so i had to take this class to further explore… whatever.</li>
    </ul><br>
        <p><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I have 17 tattoos.</strong> </p><br>
        <p><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong>I am just a small speck in an overwhelming universe. I long to explore the cosmic unknowns but know that is centuries, if not millennia away by which point I will be dead.</p>
