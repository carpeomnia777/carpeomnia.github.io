    <ul>
      <li><span>Personal background: Born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I attended to R.I.T. until it proved too
          expensive and came
          back home where i&#39;ve started a family and work while still reaching for the dream of being a full-stack
          developer. I have 2 daughters and a brand new Australian Cattle dog puppy and Australian Shepherd puppy. I
          also
          enjoy being very bad at video games.</span></li>

          full-time
          job and family amongst other things, managed to maintain a 3.87 GPA. I am beyond ready for this to be done but
          I
          owe it to past me to see this through.</span></li>
      <li><span>Background in this subject: I&#39;ve produced work for clients as well as working with other developers
          using
          web markup and scripting. I am now a professional developer for Bank of America</span></li>

      <li><span>Primary Computer Platform: I use Windows 10 on my desktop and laptop. But I have no strong opinions
          about
          other OS, like some do.</span></li>
      <li><span>Course I&#39;m Taking & Why:</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span>WEB215- Web markup and scripting- IT was required for my degree path and that is the ONLY
            reason.</span></li>

      <li><span>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I have 17 tattoos.</span></li>
      <li><span>I&#39;d also like to share:</strong>I am just a small speck in an overwhelming universe. I long to
          explore the
          cosmic unknowns but know that is centuries, if not millennia away by which point I will be dead.</span></li>
