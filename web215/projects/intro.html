      <li><span>Personal background: Born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I attended to R.I.T. until it proved too expensive and came
        back home where i&#39;ve started a family and work while still reaching for the dream of being a full-stack
        developer. I have 2 daughters and a brand new Australian Cattle dog puppy and Australian Shepherd puppy. I also
        enjoy being very bad at video games.</span></li>

        job and family amongst other things, managed to maintain a 3.87 GPA. I am beyond ready for this to be done but I
        owe it to past me to see this through.</span></li>

      </ul>
      <li><span>Primary Computer Platform: I use Windows 10 on my desktop and laptop. But I have no strong opinions about
        other OS, like some do.</span></li>
      <li><span>Course I&#39;m Taking & Why:</span></li>
      <ul>
      <li><span>WEB215- Web markup and scripting- IT was required for my degree path and that is the ONLY reason.</span></li>

    <li><span>I&#39;d also like to share:</strong>I am just a small speck in an overwhelming universe. I long to explore the
      cosmic unknowns but know that is centuries, if not millennia away by which point I will be dead.</span></li>
