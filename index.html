    <h1>Hi, I'm Chris Wilson</h1>
<p>Personal background: Born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I went to R.I.T. until it proved too expensive and came back home where i’ve started a family and work while still reaching for the dream of being a full-stack developer. I have 2 daughters and 4 pet rats. I also enjoy being very bad at video games.</p>
<p>Professional Background: I currently work in the logistics sector. I am also a part of a software developer training agency, 100Devs.</p>
<p></p>Academic background: I am currently pursuing a degree in Full Stack Development and, despite have a full-time job and family amongst other things, manage to maintain a 3.87 GPA</p>
<p>Background in this subject:  I’ve produced work for clients as well as working with other developers using web markup and scripting. I’m usually the weird one because i actually prefer EJS (embedding javascript) over other templating languages like handlebars.</p>
<p>Primary Computer Platform:  I use Windows 10 on my desktop and laptop. But I have no strong opinions about other OS, like some do.</p>
<ul>
<span>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</span>
<li>WEB115- Web markup and scripting- IT was required for my degree path and I also want to strengthen my foundation.</li>
<li>DBA120-Database programming- Not a fan, I only take it because it’s required. I usually use mongodb and it’s good enough for my needs most of the time but I'm interested and open to see what I will learn.</li>
<li>ABC123 - Advanced Alphabet Soup- It had very rigorous prereqs, but i’m very passionate about the art that is Alphabet soup so the class was a no brainer. I prefer my alphabet soup with a tomato base and only “Os” and meatballs. That counts… right?</li>
<li>FYI002 - Introduction to Whatever-I’ve been known to have a very small nihilistic streak but I also value learning, so i had to take this class to further explore… whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I have 17 tattoos. </p>
<p>I'd also like to share:I am just a small speck in an overwhelming universe. I long to explore the cosmic unknowns but know that is centuries, if not millennia away by which point I will be dead. That sucks</p>
